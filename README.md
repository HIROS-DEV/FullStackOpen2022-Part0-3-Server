Part2 is Communicating with server : (URL:https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2) <br/>

Through the above courses, student had to created simple phonebook SPA.
And, I finished the task.

Probably, I will delete the app in the Heroku (Because, Heroku can not create more than 5 application in the free plan). <br/>
But as of today, the application is working in this URL (https://phonebook-fullstack-tuts.herokuapp.com/)
